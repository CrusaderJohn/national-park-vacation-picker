# National Park Vacation Picker

## Project Description:
This web application will allow for the prediction of which week will be the best to go on vacation in a certain year. It will do this by collecting and analyzing historical data through the past x years and compiling an average temperature range which would suit vacation weather. The application will take the user’s input as to what National Park in Ontario they would like to vacation at, then process the data attributed to that location to provide the user with the potential best week in terms of high temperatures. Along with that, the application will provide the user with a route to their destination by taking their address as an input and calculating the distance and time it will take to get there.

## Here are screenshots showcasing the functionality and look of our webpage

## Motivation for Development 
We want to provide a way for people who only have a certain amount of time off in a year to know exactly when would be the best opportunity to go on vacation at one of the Provincial Parks on our list.
