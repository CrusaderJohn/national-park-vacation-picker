## Project Title:
National Park Vacation Picker

## Project Description:
This web application will allow for the prediction of which week will be the best to go on vacation in a certain year. 
It will do this by collecting and analyzing historical data through the past x years and compiling an average 
temperature range which would suit vacation weather. The application will take the userâ€™s input as to what 
National Park in Ontario they would like to vacation at, then process the data attributed to that location to 
provide the user with the potential best week in terms of high temperatures.

## User Story:
AS A person with vacation time
I WANT a web application to help me pick out a good week for vacation
SO THAT when it comes time to go on vacation
THEN I can use my app to find a warm, dry week in my preferred location
